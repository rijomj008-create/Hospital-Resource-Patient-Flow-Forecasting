# Hospital Resource Patient Flow Forecasting
Irish public hospitals are operating at an average bed occupancy of 95.9%, far exceeding the 85% safe limit, while national projections forecast a 40% rise in inpatient bed demand by 2040. To address this challenge, this project develops a Hospital Resource & Patient Flow Forecasting Model built on Microsoft Azure. Using open Irish hospital admission data, weather variables, and operational KPIs, the model predicts daily patient inflow and bed utilisation. The end-to-end pipeline—Azure SQL Database → Data Factory → Power BI Service—automates data ingestion, forecasting, and visualisation, providing real-time decision intelligence to optimise staffing, reduce emergency bottlenecks, and enhance capacity planning across healthcare facilities.
